# Cat-non-Cat-Classification-Projects
This project classifies the image of cats. I used a four-layer neural network with different size of nodes and implemented with NumPy library. The Relu and sigmoid function is used for the non-linear activation function. After training, we achieve an accuracy of over 70%.
